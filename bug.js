This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.deviceId` to uniquely identify a device.  The `deviceId` can change across app restarts or even within the same session, breaking functionality that relies on persistent device identification. This is often seen in scenarios involving user accounts or analytics where a stable identifier is crucial.  The issue stems from the underlying implementation of `deviceId` in Expo, which is not guaranteed to remain consistent across app sessions.

```javascript
// buggy code
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

const deviceId = Constants.deviceId;
console.log('Device ID:', deviceId);
// ... code that uses deviceId to identify the user ...
```
